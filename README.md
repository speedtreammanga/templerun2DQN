# Temple Run 2: Frozen Shadows DQN

I would not advise for you to run this code, the code takes screenshots of the game to train the model however,
the coordinates of the screenshots fit my screen size.
If you really want to dabble into it, you can modify the `CAPTURE_BOX` constant which can be found
in the `gym.py` file.

## Install
- Install Poetry
- Navigate to repo folder
- Run `poetry install` to install dependencies

## Execution
- Make sure to have the game opened in your browser. [Game can be found here](https://poki.com/en/g/temple-run-2-frozen-shadows)
- Make sure to play through the tutorial section of the game first.
- Execute `main_dqn.py` and click on the game window so that it has the keyboard focus.
